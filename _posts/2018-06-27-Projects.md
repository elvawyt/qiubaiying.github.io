# Music2Vec:Music recommendation system based on GloVe.
- [Click here to see detail](https://github.com/elvawyt/Music2Vec)
- Used GloVe method to embed the item into vector space. Modeled music as words and the song lists as sentences. The
‘corpus’ of music is used as an input to the word embedding algorithm.
- Computed item similarity and used KNN algorithm for classification and recommendation by python



# Java Resources Sharing Website based on JavaEE.
- Excellent Graduation project
- Courses: Software Engineering, Database, Object-Oriented Programming, Data Structure
- Developed fully functional responsive prototypes using HTML/HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and JQuery.
- Implemented MVC architecture to isolate each layer of the application to implement high Cohesion & low Coupling.

# Information Retrieval: Information diffusion and Topic modeling from text-based cascades.
- Discovered the topics in documents via Latent Dirichlet allocation with collapsed Gibbs sampling.
- Modeled and predicting the popularity of given topic via Hawkes process by python.
